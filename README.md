### Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form


## Exercise 00:
### My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form
Create a class in Orthodox Canonical Form that represents a fixed-point number

## Exercise 01:
### Towards a more useful fixed-point number class
The previous exercise was a good start but our class is pretty useless. It can only
represent the value 0.0.

## Exercise 02:
### Exercise 02: Now we’re talking
Add public member functions to your class to overload the following operators:

## Exercise 03:
### BSP
Now that you have a functional Fixed class, it would be nice to use it.

Implement a function which indicates whether a point is inside of a triangle or not.
Very useful, isn’t it?
